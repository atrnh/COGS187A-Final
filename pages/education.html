			  <h2>education </h2>
			  <p>The Department of Visual Arts offers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in media, studio, computing, and art history; a Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) across painting, drawing, sculpture, performance, computing, film, video, and photography; and Ph.D. in art and media history, theory and criticism.  The Ph.D. program includes a concentration in artistic practice -- one of the first doctoral programs in the country designed for practicing artists, and one of the few worldwide to be housed in a Ph.D. department of art history. </p>

<p>Our department offers a unique intellectual environment in which exchange and dialogue between art practitioners, historians, and critics is openly encouraged.  While students may choose to focus within one particular area, they are encouraged to push the boundaries of their chosen medium and to reach across media-specific boundaries into new forms of art making.
</p>
<p>The department is currently developing a number of new curricular initiatives along with new pedagogical strategies that integrate the classroom, the studio, and the laboratory with various environmental, urban, and institutional sites.  Just as we provide disciplinary knowledges and skills in specific artistic and scholarly pursuits within Visual Arts, we also provide transferable knowledges and skills that prepare students to be intellectually and creatively agile, in whatever discipline they may pursue.  We understand Visual Art as a research-based activity that is both critical and creative, cultivating hybrid forms of cultural practice and analysis that enrich students' ability to intervene in the conditions of knowledge production, generate new methods and creative processes, in whatever professional field they may pursue.</p>

				<h3>undergraduate program</h3>
			  <p>The Department of Visual Arts offers four undergraduate majors: Art History Theory and Criticism, Media, Studio and Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts (ICAM). The scope of the courses offered is wide and concerned with developing a coherent and informed understanding of past and recent developments in art and art history. Students who transfer to UC San Diego in their second or third year may petition to substitute courses taken at other colleges or universities for our lower-division requirements. However, they must show that the courses they have successfully completed are comparable to our own. All courses taken to satisfy major requirements must be taken for a letter grade, and only grades of C- or better will be accepted in the Visual Arts Major. Additionally, the Department offers minors in several areas of study: Art History, Computing, ICAM, Digital Video and Film Production, Photography, Studio, and History and Criticism of Film and Video. A minor consists of seven courses, at least five of which must be upper-division. Prospective visual arts minors should consult with the departmental advisor for assistance in planning an appropriate minor.</p>

				<h3>mfa program</h3>
			  <p>The Master of Fine Arts (MFA) program at UC San Diego is one of the nation’s top fine arts program. The most recent U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks the MFA program as 13th in overall fine arts, 7th in Mutlimedia / Visual Communications, and 21st in Sculpture. The MFA program was also selected as one of Art Info's Top 10 MFA Program's That Give You the Most Bang for your Buck.  </p>

<p>The course of study at the Department of Visual Arts provides for mobility within a range of traditional and media-based components and encourages collaboration. In addition to working in a broad array of mediums, MFA students have also been recognized widely for their accolades as well as exhibitions and are also actively involved in the regional arts community. The program is designed to provide professional training for the student who proposes to pursue a career within the field of art -- including art-making, criticism, and theory. The scope of the UC San Diego MFA Program includes but is not limited to painting, sculpture, performance, installation, environmental art, photography, film, video, and computing for the arts. The Department seeks to provide an integrated and comprehensive introduction to the possibilities of contemporary art production, the intellectual structures which underlie them, and the "world view" which they entail. All art-making activities are considered serious intellectual endeavors, and all students in the program find themselves confronted by the need to develop their intellectual and critical abilities in the working out of their artistic positions.</p>

				<h3>art history ph.d</h3>
			  <p>Launching in 2002, the Art History, Theory, and Criticism Ph. D. is housed within one of the nation’s leading centers of art practice and graduate education in studio, media, and—most recently—digital media. The offering of the Ph.D. degree is based on the department’s foundational premise that the production of art and the critical, theoretical, and historical reflection upon it inherently and necessarily participate in a single discursive community. The Department of Visual Arts offers a Ph.D. degree in Art History, Theory, and Criticism with concentrations in Ancient Art and Medieval Art, Renaissance Art, European Early Modern Art, Modern Art, Contemporary Art, Arts of the Americas, and Media Studies, in addition to an Art Practice [link to art practice page] track. Offering a distinct alternative to existing Ph.D. programs in art history, our program has a unique curriculum that treats the study of art as part of a broader inquiry into the practices, objects, and discourses that constitute the art world.</p>
